--- abstract

There are many situations in which it is desirable to take measurements of data
which people consider sensitive. In these cases, the entity taking the
measurement is usually not interested in people's individual responses but
rather in aggregated data. Conventional methods require collecting individual
responses and then aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy
and rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical. This document
describes a multi-party distributed aggregation protocol (DAP) for privacy
preserving measurement (PPM) which can be used to collect aggregate data without
revealing any individual user's data.

# Introduction

This document describes the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) for privacy
preserving measurement. The protocol is executed by a large set of clients and
two aggregator servers. The aggregators' goal is to compute some aggregate
statistic over the clients' inputs without learning the inputs themselves. This
is made possible by distributing the computation among the aggregators in such a
way that, as long as at least one of them executes the protocol honestly, no
input is ever seen in the clear by any aggregator.

## Change Log

(\*) Indicates a change that breaks wire compatibility with the previous draft.

11:

- Remove support for multi-collection of batches, as well as the fixed-size
  query type's `by_batch_id` query. (\*)

- Clarify purpose of report ID uniqueness.

- Bump version tag from "dap-10" to "dap-11". (\*)

10:

- Editorial changes from httpdir early review.

- Poll collection jobs with HTTP GET instead of POST. (\*)

- Upload reports with HTTP POST instead of PUT. (\*)

- Clarify requirements for problem documents.

- Provide guidance on batch sizes when running VDAFs with non-trivial
  aggregation parameters.

- Bump version tag from "dap-09" to "dap-10". (\*)

09:

- Fixed-size queries: make the maximum batch size optional.

- Fixed-size queries: require current-batch queries to return distinct batches.

- Clarify requirements for compatible VDAFs.

- Clarify rules around creating and abandoning aggregation jobs.

- Recommend that all task parameters are visible to all parties.

- Revise security considerations section.

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07 to 08 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-07" to "dap-09". (\*)

08:

- Clarify requirements for initializing aggregation jobs.

- Add more considerations for Sybil attacks.

- Expand guidance around choosing the VDAF verification key.

- Add an error type registry for the aggregation sub-protocol.

07:

- Bump version tag from "dap-06" to "dap-07". This is a bug-fix revision: the
  editors overlooked some changes we intended to pick up in the previous
  version. (\*)

06:

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06 to 07 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Overhaul security considerations (#488).

- Adopt revised ping-pong interface in draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07 (#494).

- Add aggregation parameter to `AggregateShareAad` (#498). (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-05" to "dap-06". (\*)

05:

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-05 to 06 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Specialize the protocol for two-party VDAFs (i.e., one Leader and One
  Helper). Accordingly, update the aggregation sub-protocol to use the new
  "ping-pong" interface for two-party VDAFs introduced in
  draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06. (\*)

- Allow the following actions to be safely retried: aggregation job creation,
  collection job creation, and requesting the Helper's aggregate share.

- Merge error types that are related.

- Drop recommendation to generate IDs using a cryptographically secure
  pseudorandom number generator wherever pseudorandomness is not required.

- Require HPKE config identifiers to be unique.

- Bump version tag from "dap-04" to "dap-05". (\*)

04:

- Introduce resource oriented HTTP API. (#278, #398, #400) (\*)

- Clarify security requirements for choosing VDAF verify key. (#407, #411)

- Require Clients to provide nonce and random input when sharding inputs. (#394,
  #425) (\*)

- Add interval of time spanned by constituent reports to Collection message.
  (#397, #403) (\*)

- Update share validation requirements based on latest security analysis. (#408,
  #410)

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-03 to 05 {{!VDAF}}. (#429) (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-03" to "dap-04". (#424) (\*)

03:

- Enrich the "fixed_size" query type to allow the Collector to request a
  recently aggregated batch without knowing the batch ID in advance. ID
  discovery was previously done out-of-band. (\*)

- Allow Aggregators to advertise multiple HPKE configurations. (\*)

- Clarify requirements for enforcing anti-replay. Namely, while it is sufficient
  to detect repeated report IDs, it is also enough to detect repeated IDs and
  timestamps.

- Remove the extensions from the Report and add extensions to the plaintext
  payload of each ReportShare. (\*)

- Clarify that extensions are mandatory to implement: If an Aggregator does not
  recognize a ReportShare's extension, it must reject it.

- Clarify that Aggregators must reject any ReportShare with repeated extension
  types.

- Specify explicitly how to serialize the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)
  string for HPKE encryption. This clarifies an ambiguity in the previous
  version. (\*)

- Change the length tag for the aggregation parameter to 32 bits. (\*)

- Use the same prefix ("application") for all media types. (\*)

- Make input share validation more explicit, including adding a new
  ReportShareError variant, "report_too_early", for handling reports too far in
  the future. (\*)

- Improve alignment of problem details usage with {{!RFC7807}}. Replace
  "reportTooLate" problem document type with "repjortRejected" and clarify
  handling of rejected reports in the upload sub-protocol. (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-02" to "dap-03". (\*)

02:

- Define a new task configuration parameter, called the "query type", that
  allows tasks to partition reports into batches in different ways. In the
  current draft, the Collector specifies a "query", which the Aggregators use to
  guide selection of the batch. Two query types are defined: the "time_interval"
  type captures the semantics of draft 01; and the "fixed_size" type allows the
  Leader to partition the reports arbitrarily, subject to the constraint that
  each batch is roughly the same size. (\*)

- Define a new task configuration parameter, called the task "expiration", that
  defines the lifetime of a given task.

- Specify requirements for HTTP request authentication rather than a concrete
  scheme. (Draft 01 required the use of the `DAP-Auth-Token` header; this is now
  optional.)

- Make "task_id" an optional parameter of the "/hpke_config" endpoint.

- Add report count to CollectResp message. (\*)

- Increase message payload sizes to accommodate VDAFs with input and aggregate
  shares larger than 2^16-1 bytes. (\*)

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-01 to 03 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-01" to "dap-02". (\*)

- Rename the report nonce to the "report ID" and move it to the top of the
  structure. (\*)

- Clarify when it is safe for an Aggregator to evict various data artifacts from
  long-term storage.

{:br}

This document uses the presentation language of {{!RFC8446}} to define messages
in the DAP protocol. Encoding and decoding of these messages as byte strings
also follows {{RFC8446}}.

# Overview {#overview}

The protocol is executed by a large set of Clients and a pair of servers
referred to as "Aggregators". Each Client's input to the protocol is its
measurement (or set of measurements, e.g., counts of some user behavior). Given
the input set of measurements `x_1, ..., x_n` held by `n` Clients, and an
aggregation parameter `p` shared by the Aggregators, the goal of DAP is to
compute `y = F(p, x_1, ..., x_n)` for some function `F` while revealing nothing
else about the measurements. We call `F` the "aggregation function."

This protocol is extensible and allows for the addition of new cryptographic
schemes that implement the VDAF interface specified in
{{!VDAF=I-D.draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-08}}. This protocol only supports VDAFs which
require a single collection to provide useful results.

VDAFs rely on secret sharing to protect the privacy of the measurements. Rather
than sending its input in the clear, each Client shards its measurement into a
pair of "input shares" and sends an input share to each of the Aggregators. This
provides two important properties:

* Given only one of the input shares, it is impossible to deduce the plaintext
  measurement from which it was generated.

* It allows the Aggregators to compute the aggregation function by first
  aggregating up their input shares locally into "aggregate shares", then
  combining the aggregate shares into the aggregate result.

{: #dap-topology title="System Architecture"}

The main participants in the protocol are as follows:

Collector:
: The entity which wants to obtain the aggregate of the measurements generated
  by the Clients. Any given measurement task will have a single Collector.

Client(s):
: The parties which directly take the measurement(s) and report them to the
  DAP protocol. In order to provide reasonable levels of privacy, there must be
  a large number of Clients.

Aggregator:
: A server which receives report shares. Each Aggregator works with its
  co-Aggregator to compute the aggregate result. Any given measurement task
  will have two Aggregators: a Leader and a Helper.

Leader:
: The Aggregator responsible for coordinating the protocol. It receives the
  reports, splits them into report shares, distributes the report shares to the
  Helper, and orchestrates the process of computing the aggregate result as
  requested by the Collector.

Helper:
: The Aggregator assisting the Leader with the computation. The protocol is
  designed so that the Helper is relatively lightweight, with most of the
  operational burden borne by the Leader.

{:br}

The basic unit of DAP is the "task" which represents a single measurement
process (though potentially aggregating multiple batches of measurements). The
definition of a task includes the following parameters:

* The type of each measurement.
* The aggregation function to compute (e.g., sum, mean, etc.).
* The set of Aggregators and necessary cryptographic keying material to use.
* The VDAF to execute, which to some extent is dictated by the previous choices.
* The minimum "batch size" of reports which can be aggregated.
* The rate at which measurements can be taken, i.e., the "minimum batch
  duration".

These parameters are distributed to the Clients, Aggregators, and Collector
before the task begins. This document does not specify a distribution
mechanism, but it is important that all protocol participants agree on the
task's configuration. Each task is identified by a unique 32-byte ID which is
used to refer to it in protocol messages.

During the lifetime of a task, each Client records its own measurement
value(s), packages them up into a report, and sends them to the Leader. Each
share is separately encrypted for each Aggregator so that even though they pass
through the Leader, the Leader is unable to see or modify them. Depending on
the task, the Client may only send one report or may send many reports over
time.

The Leader distributes the shares to the Helper and orchestrates the process of
verifying them (see {{validating-inputs}}) and assembling them into a final
aggregate result for the Collector. Depending on the VDAF, it may be possible to
incrementally process each report as it comes in, or may be necessary to wait
until the entire batch of reports is received.

## Validating Inputs {#validating-inputs}

An essential task of any data collection pipeline is ensuring that the data
being aggregated is "valid". In DAP, input validation is complicated by the fact
that none of the entities other than the Client ever sees that Client's
plaintext measurement.

In order to address this problem, the Aggregators engage in a secure,
multi-party computation specified by the chosen VDAF {{!VDAF}} in order to
prepare a report for aggregation. At the beginning of this computation, each
Aggregator is in possession of an input share uploaded by the Client. At the end
of the computation, each Aggregator is in possession of either an "output share"
that is ready to be aggregated or an indication that a valid output share could
not be computed.

To facilitate this computation, the input shares generated by the Client
include information used by the Aggregators during aggregation in order to
validate their corresponding output shares. For example, Prio3 includes a
zero-knowledge proof of the input's validity (see {{Section 7.1 of !VDAF}}).
which the Aggregators can jointly verify and reject the report if it cannot be
verified. However, they do not learn anything about the individual report other
than that it is valid.

The specific properties attested to in the proof vary depending on the
measurement being taken. For instance, to measure the time the user took
performing a given task the proof might demonstrate that the value reported was
within a certain range (e.g., 0-60 seconds). By contrast, to report which of a
set of `N` options the user select, the report might contain `N` integers and
the proof would demonstrate that `N-1` were `0` and the other was `1`.

It is important to recognize that "validity" is distinct from "correctness". For
instance, the user might have spent 30s on a task but the Client might report
60s. This is a problem with any measurement system and DAP does not attempt to
address it; it merely ensures that the data is within acceptable limits, so the
Client could not report 10^6s or -20s.

# Message Transport {#message-transport}

Communications between DAP participants are carried over HTTP {{!RFC9110}}. Use
of HTTPS is REQUIRED to provide server authentication and confidentiality.

## HTTPS Request Authentication {#request-authentication}

DAP is made up of several interactions in which different subsets of the
protocol's participants interact with each other.

In those cases where a channel between two participants is tunneled through
another protocol participant, DAP mandates the use of public-key encryption
using {{!HPKE=RFC9180}} to ensure that only the intended recipient can see a
message in the clear.

In other cases, DAP requires HTTP client authentication as well as server
authentication. Any authentication scheme that is composable with HTTP is
allowed. For example:

* {{!OAuth2=RFC6749}} credentials are presented in an Authorization HTTP header,
  which can be added to any DAP protocol message.

* TLS client certificates can be used to authenticate the underlying transport.

* The `DAP-Auth-Token` HTTP header described in
  {{?I-D.draft-dcook-ppm-dap-interop-test-design-04}}.

This flexibility allows organizations deploying DAP to use existing well-known
HTTP authentication mechanisms that they already support. Discovering what
authentication mechanisms are supported by a DAP participant is outside of this
document's scope.

## Errors

Errors can be reported in DAP both as HTTP status codes and as problem detail
objects {{!RFC9457}} in the response body. For example, if the HTTP client sends
a request using a method not allowed in this document, then the server MAY
return HTTP status 405 Method Not Allowed.

When the server responds with an error status code, it SHOULD provide additional
information using a problem detail object. If the response body does consist of
a problem detail object, the HTTP status code MUST indicate a client or server
error (the 4xx or 5xx classes, respectively, from {{Section 15 of !RFC9110}}).

To facilitate automatic response to errors, this document defines the following
standard tokens for use in the "type" field (within the DAP URN namespace
"urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:"):

| Type                       | Description                                                                                  |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| invalidMessage             | A message received by a protocol participant could not be parsed or otherwise was invalid. |
| unrecognizedTask           | A server received a message with an unknown task ID. |
| unrecognizedAggregationJob | A server received a message with an unknown aggregation job ID. |
| outdatedConfig             | The message was generated using an outdated configuration. |
| reportRejected             | Report could not be processed for an unspecified reason. |
| reportTooEarly             | Report could not be processed because its timestamp is too far in the future. |
| batchInvalid               | The batch boundary check for Collector's query failed. |
| invalidBatchSize           | There are an invalid number of reports in the batch. |
| batchQueriedMultipleTimes  | A batch was queried with multiple distinct aggregation parameters. |
| batchMismatch              | Aggregators disagree on the report shares that were aggregated in a batch. |
| unauthorizedRequest        | Authentication of an HTTP request failed (see {{request-authentication}}). |
| missingTaskID              | HPKE configuration was requested without specifying a task ID. |
| stepMismatch               | The Aggregators disagree on the current step of the DAP aggregation protocol. |
| batchOverlap               | A request's query includes reports that were previously collected in a different batch. |

This list is not exhaustive. The server MAY return errors set to a URI other
than those defined above. Servers MUST NOT use the DAP URN namespace for errors
not listed in the appropriate IANA registry (see {{urn-space}}). The "detail"
member of the Problem Details document includes additional diagnostic
information.

When the task ID is known (see {{task-configuration}}), the problem document
SHOULD include an additional "taskid" member containing the ID encoded in Base
64 using the URL and filename safe alphabet with no padding defined in
{{Sections 5 and 3.2 of !RFC4648}}.

In the remainder of this document, the tokens in the table above are used to
refer to error types, rather than the full URNs. For example, an "error of type
'invalidMessage'" refers to an error document with "type" value
"urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:invalidMessage".

This document uses the verbs "abort" and "alert with [some error message]" to
describe how protocol participants react to various error conditions. This
implies HTTP status code 400 Bad Request unless explicitly specified otherwise.

# Protocol Definition

DAP has three major interactions which need to be defined:

* Uploading reports from the Client to the Aggregators, specified in
  {{upload-flow}}
* Computing the results for a given measurement task, specified in
  {{aggregate-flow}}
* Collecting aggregated results, specified in {{collect-flow}}

Each of these interactions is defined in terms of "resources". In this section
we define these resources and the messages used to act on them.

The following are some basic type definitions used in other messages:

~~~
/* ASCII encoded URL. e.g., "https://example.com" */
opaque Url<1..2^16-1>;

uint64 Duration; /* Number of seconds elapsed between two instants */

uint64 Time; /* seconds elapsed since start of UNIX epoch */

/* An interval of time of length duration, where start is included and (start +
duration) is excluded. */
struct {
  Time start;
  Duration duration;
} Interval;

/* An ID used to uniquely identify a report in the context of a DAP task. */
opaque ReportID[16];

/* The various roles in the DAP protocol. */
enum {
  collector(0),
  client(1),
  leader(2),
  helper(3),
  (255)
} Role;

/* Identifier for a server's HPKE configuration */
uint8 HpkeConfigId;

/* An HPKE ciphertext. */
struct {
  HpkeConfigId config_id;    /* config ID */
  opaque enc<1..2^16-1>;     /* encapsulated HPKE key */
  opaque payload<1..2^32-1>; /* ciphertext */
} HpkeCiphertext;

/* Represent a zero-length byte string. */
struct {} Empty;
~~~

DAP uses the 16-byte `ReportID` as the nonce parameter for the VDAF `shard` and
`prep_init` methods (see {{!VDAF, Section 5}}). Additionally, DAP includes
messages defined in the VDAF specification encoded as opaque byte strings within
various DAP messages. Thus, for a VDAF to be compatible with DAP, it MUST
specify a `NONCE_SIZE` of 16 bytes, and MUST specify encodings for the following
VDAF types:

* PublicShare
* InputShare
* AggParam
* AggShare
* PrepShare
* PrepMessage

## Queries {#query}

Aggregated results are computed based on sets of reports, called "batches". The
Collector influences which reports are used in a batch via a "query." The
Aggregators use this query to carry out the aggregation flow and produce
aggregate shares encrypted to the Collector.

This document defines the following query types:

~~~
enum {
  reserved(0), /* Reserved for testing purposes */
  time_interval(1),
  fixed_size(2),
  (255)
} QueryType;
~~~

The time_interval query type is described in {{time-interval-query}}; the
fixed_size query type is described in {{fixed-size-query}}. Future
specifications may introduce new query types as needed (see {{query-type-reg}}).
Implementations are free to implement only a subset of the available query
types.

A query includes parameters used by the Aggregators to select a batch of
reports specific to the given query type. A query is defined as follows:

~~~
struct {
  QueryType query_type;
  select (Query.query_type) {
    case time_interval: Interval batch_interval;
    case fixed_size: Empty;
  }
} Query;
~~~

The query is issued in-band as part of the collect interaction
({{collect-flow}}). Its content is determined by the "query type", which in turn
is encoded by the "query configuration" configured out-of-band. All query types
have the following configuration parameters in common:

- `min_batch_size` - The smallest number of reports the batch is allowed to
  include. In a sense, this parameter controls the degree of privacy that will
  be obtained: the larger the minimum batch size, the higher degree of privacy.
  However, this ultimately depends on the application and the nature of the
  measurements and aggregation function.

- `time_precision` - Clients use this value to truncate their report timestamps;
  see {{upload-flow}}. Additional semantics may apply, depending on the query
  type. (See {{batch-validation}} for details.)

The parameters pertaining to specific query types are described in
{{time-interval-query}} and {{fixed-size-query}}.

### Time-interval Queries {#time-interval-query}

The first query type, `time_interval`, is designed to support applications in
which reports are collected over a long period of time. The Collector specifies
a "batch interval" that determines the time range for reports included in the
batch. For each report in the batch, the time at which that report was generated
(see {{upload-flow}}) MUST fall within the batch interval specified by the
Collector.

Typically the Collector issues queries for which the batch intervals are
continuous, monotonically increasing, and have the same duration. For example,
the sequence of batch intervals `(1659544000, 1000)`, `(1659545000, 1000)`,
`(1659546000, 1000)`, `(1659547000, 1000)` satisfies these conditions. (The
first element of the pair denotes the start of the batch interval and the second
denotes the duration.) However, this is not a requirement--the Collector may
decide to issue queries out-of-order. In addition, the Collector may need to
vary the duration to adjust to changing report upload rates.

### Fixed-size Queries {#fixed-size-query}

The `fixed_size` query type is used to support applications in which the
Collector needs the ability to strictly control the batch size. This is
particularly important for controlling the amount of noise added to reports by
Clients (or added to aggregate shares by Aggregators) in order to achieve
differential privacy.

For this query type, the Aggregators group reports into arbitrary batches such
that each batch has roughly the same number of reports. These batches are
identified by opaque "batch IDs", allocated in an arbitrary fashion by the
Leader.

The Collector will not know the set of batch IDs available for collection. To
get the aggregate of a batch, the Collector issues a query, which does not
include any information specifying a particular batch (see {{query}}). The
Leader selects a recent batch to aggregate. The Leader MUST select a batch that
has not yet been associated with a collection job.

In addition to the minimum batch size common to all query types, the
configuration may include a parameter `max_batch_size` that determines maximum
number of reports per batch.

If the configuration does not include `max_batch_size`, then the Aggregators
can output any batch size that is larger than or equal to `min_batch_size`.
This is useful for applications that are not concerned with sample size, i.e.,
the privacy guarantee is not affected by the sampling rate of the population,
therefore a larger than expected batch size does not weaken the designed privacy
guarantee.

Implementation note: The goal for the Aggregators is to aggregate the same
number of reports in each batch. The target batch size is deployment-specific,
and may be equal to or greater than the minimum batch size. Deciding how soon
batches should be output is also deployment-specific. Exactly sizing batches may
be challenging for Leader deployments in which multiple, independent nodes
running the aggregate interaction (see {{aggregate-flow}}) need to be
coordinated. The difference between the minimum batch size and maximum batch
size is in part intended to allow room for error, and allow a range of target
batch sizes.

## Task Configuration {#task-configuration}

Prior to the start of execution of the protocol, each participant must agree on
the configuration for each task. A task is uniquely identified by its task ID:

~~~
opaque TaskID[32];
~~~

The task ID value MUST be a globally unique sequence of bytes. Each task has
the following parameters associated with it:

* `leader_aggregator_url`: A URL relative to which the Leader's API resources
   can be found.
* `helper_aggregator_url`: A URL relative to which the Helper's API resources
  can be found.
* The query configuration for this task (see {{query}}). This determines the
  query type for batch selection and the properties that all batches for this
  task must have. The party MUST NOT configure the task if it does not
  recognize the query type.
* `task_expiration`: The time up to which Clients are expected to upload to this
  task. The task is considered completed after this time. Aggregators MAY reject
  reports that have timestamps later than `task_expiration`.
* A unique identifier for the VDAF in use for the task, e.g., one of the VDAFs
  defined in {{Section 10 of !VDAF}}.

Note that the `leader_aggregator_url` and `helper_aggregator_url` values may
include arbitrary path components.

In addition, in order to facilitate the aggregation and collect protocols, each
of the Aggregators is configured with following parameters:

* `collector_hpke_config`: The {{!HPKE=RFC9180}} configuration of the Collector
  (described in {{hpke-config}}); see {{compliance}} for information about the
  HPKE configuration algorithms.
* `vdaf_verify_key`: The VDAF verification key shared by the Aggregators. This
  key is used in the aggregation interaction ({{aggregate-flow}}). The security
  requirements are described in {{verification-key}}.

Finally, the Collector is configured with the HPKE secret key corresponding to
`collector_hpke_config`.

A task's parameters are immutable for the lifetime of that task. The only way to
change parameters or to rotate secret values like collector HPKE configuration
or the VDAF verification key is to configure a new task.

## Resource URIs

DAP is defined in terms of "resources", such as reports ({{upload-flow}}),
aggregation jobs ({{aggregate-flow}}), and collection jobs ({{collect-flow}}).
Each resource has an associated URI. Resource URIs are specified by a sequence
of string literals and variables. Variables are expanded into strings according
to the following rules:

* Variables `{leader}` and `{helper}` are replaced with the base URL of the
  Leader and Helper respectively (the base URL is defined in
  {{task-configuration}}).
* Variables `{task-id}`, `{aggregation-job-id}`, and `{collection-job-id}` are
  replaced with the task ID ({{task-configuration}}), aggregation job ID
  ({{agg-init}}), and collection job ID ({{collect-init}}) respectively. The
  value MUST be encoded in its URL-safe, unpadded Base 64 representation as
  specified in {{Sections 5 and 3.2 of !RFC4648}}.

For example, given a helper URL "https://example.com/api/dap", task ID "f0 16 34
47 36 4c cf 1b c0 e3 af fc ca 68 73 c9 c3 81 f6 4a cd f9 02 06 62 f8 3f 46 c0 72
19 e7" and an aggregation job ID "95 ce da 51 e1 a9 75 23 68 b0 d9 61 f9 46 61
28" (32 and 16 byte octet strings, represented in hexadecimal), resource URI
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` would be
expanded into
`https://example.com/api/dap/tasks/8BY0RzZMzxvA46_8ymhzycOB9krN-QIGYvg_RsByGec/aggregation_jobs/lc7aUeGpdSNosNlh-UZhKA`.

## Uploading Reports {#upload-flow}

Clients periodically upload reports to the Leader. Each report contains two
"report shares", one for the Leader and another for the Helper. The Helper's
report share is transmitted by the Leader during the aggregation interaction
(see {{aggregate-flow}}).

### HPKE Configuration Request {#hpke-config}

Before the Client can upload its report to the Leader, it must know the HPKE
configuration of each Aggregator. See {{compliance}} for information on HPKE
algorithm choices.

Clients retrieve the HPKE configuration from each Aggregator by sending an HTTP
GET request to `{aggregator}/hpke_config`. Clients MAY specify a query parameter
`task_id` whose value is the task ID whose HPKE configuration they want. If the
Aggregator does not recognize the task ID, then it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`.

An Aggregator is free to use different HPKE configurations for each task with
which it is configured. If the task ID is missing from  the Client's request,
the Aggregator MAY abort with an error of type `missingTaskID`, in which case
the Client SHOULD retry the request with a well-formed task ID included.

An Aggregator responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code 200 OK and
an `HpkeConfigList` value, with media type "application/dap-hpke-config-list".
The `HpkeConfigList` structure contains one or more `HpkeConfig` structures in
decreasing order of preference. This allows an Aggregator to support multiple
HPKE configurations simultaneously.

[TODO: Allow Aggregators to return HTTP status code 403 Forbidden in deployments
that use authentication to avoid leaking information about which tasks exist.]

~~~
HpkeConfig HpkeConfigList<1..2^16-1>;

struct {
  HpkeConfigId id;
  HpkeKemId kem_id;
  HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
  HpkeAeadId aead_id;
  HpkePublicKey public_key;
} HpkeConfig;

opaque HpkePublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
uint16 HpkeAeadId; /* Defined in [HPKE] */
uint16 HpkeKemId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
uint16 HpkeKdfId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
~~~

[OPEN ISSUE: Decide whether to expand the width of the id.]

Aggregators MUST allocate distinct id values for each `HpkeConfig` in an
`HpkeConfigList`.

The Client MUST abort if any of the following happen for any HPKE config
request:

* the GET request did not return a valid HPKE config list;
* the HPKE config list is empty; or
* no HPKE config advertised by the Aggregator specifies a supported a KEM, KDF,
  or AEAD algorithm triple.

Aggregators SHOULD use HTTP caching to permit client-side caching of this
resource {{!RFC5861}}. Aggregators SHOULD favor long cache lifetimes to avoid
frequent cache revalidation, e.g., on the order of days. Aggregators can control
this cached lifetime with the Cache-Control header, as in this example:

~~~
  Cache-Control: max-age=86400
~~~

Servers should choose a `max-age` value appropriate to the lifetime of their
keys. Clients SHOULD follow the usual HTTP caching {{!RFC9111}} semantics for
HPKE configurations.

Note: Long cache lifetimes may result in Clients using stale HPKE
configurations; Aggregators SHOULD continue to accept reports with old keys for
at least twice the cache lifetime in order to avoid rejecting reports.

### Upload Request

Clients upload reports by using an HTTP POST to
`{leader}/tasks/{task-id}/reports`. The payload is a `Report`, with media type
"application/dap-report", structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  Time time;
} ReportMetadata;

struct {
  ReportMetadata report_metadata;
  opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
  HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_input_share;
  HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_input_share;
} Report;
~~~

* `report_metadata` is public metadata describing the report.

    * `report_id` is used by the Aggregators to ensure the report appears in at
      most one batch (see {{input-share-validation}}). The Client MUST generate
      this by generating 16 random bytes using a cryptographically secure random
      number generator.

    * `time` is the time at which the report was generated. The Client SHOULD
      round this value down to the nearest multiple of the task's
      `time_precision` in order to ensure that that the timestamp cannot be used
      to link a report back to the Client that generated it.

* `public_share` is the public share output by the VDAF sharding algorithm. Note
  that the public share might be empty, depending on the VDAF.

* `leader_encrypted_input_share` is the Leader's encrypted input share.

* `helper_encrypted_input_share` is the Helper's encrypted input share.

Aggregators MAY require Clients to authenticate when uploading reports (see
{{client-auth}}). If it is used, HTTP client authentication MUST use a scheme
that meets the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

The handling of the upload request by the Leader MUST be idempotent as discussed
in {{Section 9.2.2 of !RFC9110}}.

To generate a report, the Client begins by sharding its measurement into input
shares and the public share using the VDAF's sharding algorithm ({{Section 5.1
of !VDAF}}), using the report ID as the nonce:

~~~
(public_share, input_shares) = Vdaf.shard(
    measurement, /* plaintext measurement */
    report_id,   /* nonce */
    rand,        /* randomness for sharding algorithm */
)
~~~

The last input comprises the randomness consumed by the sharding algorithm. The
sharding randomness is a random byte string of length specified by the VDAF. The
Client MUST generate this using a cryptographically secure random number
generator.

The sharding algorithm will return two input shares. The first input share
returned from the sharding algorithm is considered to be the Leader's input
share, and the second input share is considered to be the Helper's input share.

The Client then wraps each input share in the following structure:

~~~
struct {
  Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} PlaintextInputShare;
~~~

Field `extensions` is set to the list of extensions intended to be consumed by
the given Aggregator. (See {{upload-extensions}}.) Field `payload` is set to the
Aggregator's input share output by the VDAF sharding algorithm.

Next, the Client encrypts each PlaintextInputShare `plaintext_input_share` as
follows:

~~~
enc, payload = SealBase(pk,
  "dap-11 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
  input_share_aad, plaintext_input_share)
~~~

where `pk` is the Aggregator's public key; `0x01` represents the Role of the
sender (always the Client); `server_role` is the Role of the intended recipient
(`0x02` for the Leader and `0x03` for the Helper), `plaintext_input_share` is
the Aggregator's PlaintextInputShare, and `input_share_aad` is an encoded
message of type InputShareAad defined below, constructed from the same values as
the corresponding fields in the report. The `SealBase()` function is as
specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE
configuration.

~~~
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  ReportMetadata report_metadata;
  opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
} InputShareAad;
~~~

The Leader responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code 201
Created. Malformed requests are handled as described in {{errors}}.
Clients SHOULD NOT upload the same measurement value in more than one report if
the Leader responds with HTTP status code 201 Created.

If the Leader does not recognize the task ID, then it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`.

The Leader responds to requests whose Leader encrypted input share uses an
out-of-date or unknown `HpkeConfig.id` value, indicated by
`HpkeCiphertext.config_id`, with error of type 'outdatedConfig'. When the Client
receives an 'outdatedConfig' error, it SHOULD invalidate any cached
HpkeConfigList and retry with a freshly generated Report. If this retried upload
does not succeed, the Client SHOULD abort and discontinue retrying.

If a report's ID matches that of a previously uploaded report, the Leader MUST
ignore it. In addition, it MAY alert the Client with error `reportRejected`. See
the implementation note in {{input-share-validation}}.

The Leader MUST ignore any report pertaining to a batch that has already been
collected (see {{input-share-validation}} for details). Otherwise, comparing
the aggregate result to the previous aggregate result may result in a privacy
violation. Note that this is also enforced by the Helper during the aggregation
interaction. The Leader MAY also abort the upload protocol and alert the
Client with error `reportRejected`.

The Leader MAY ignore any report whose timestamp is past the task's
`task_expiration`. When it does so, it SHOULD also abort the upload protocol and
alert the Client with error `reportRejected`. Client MAY choose to opt out of
the task if its own clock has passed `task_expiration`.

The Leader may need to buffer reports while waiting to aggregate them (e.g.,
while waiting for an aggregation parameter from the Collector; see
{{collect-flow}}). The Leader SHOULD NOT accept reports whose timestamps are too
far in the future. Implementors MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no
more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. If the Leader rejects a
report for this reason, it SHOULD abort the upload protocol and alert the Client
with error `reportTooEarly`. In this situation, the Client MAY re-upload the
report later on.

If the Leader's input share contains an unrecognized extension, or if two
extensions have the same ExtensionType, then the Leader MAY abort the upload
request with error "invalidMessage". Note that this behavior is not mandatory
because it requires the Leader to decrypt its input share.

### Upload Extensions {#upload-extensions}

Each PlaintextInputShare carries a list of extensions that Clients use to convey
additional information to the Aggregator. Some extensions might be intended for
both Aggregators; others may only be intended for a specific Aggregator. (For
example, a DAP deployment might use some out-of-band mechanism for an Aggregator
to verify that reports come from authenticated Clients. It will likely be useful
to bind the extension to the input share via HPKE encryption.)

Each extension is a tag-length encoded value of the following form:

~~~
struct {
  ExtensionType extension_type;
  opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
} Extension;

enum {
  TBD(0),
  (65535)
} ExtensionType;
~~~

Field "extension_type" indicates the type of extension, and "extension_data"
contains information specific to the extension.

Extensions are mandatory-to-implement: If an Aggregator receives a report
containing an extension it does not recognize, then it MUST reject the report.
(See {{input-share-validation}} for details.)

## Verifying and Aggregating Reports {#aggregate-flow}

Once a set of Clients have uploaded their reports to the Leader, the Leader can
begin the process of validating and aggregating them with the Helper. To enable
the system to handle large batches of reports, this process can be parallelized
across many "aggregation jobs" in which small subsets of the reports are
processed independently. Each aggregation job is associated with exactly one DAP
task, but a task can have many aggregation jobs.

The primary objective of an aggregation job is to run the VDAF preparation
process described in {{!VDAF, Section 5.2}} for each report in the job.
Preparation has two purposes:

1. To "refine" the input shares into "output shares" that have the desired
   aggregatable form. For some VDAFs, like Prio3, the mapping from input to
   output shares is a fixed operation depending only on the input share, but in
   general the mapping involves an aggregation parameter chosen by the
   Collector.

1. To verify that the output shares, when combined, correspond to a valid,
   refined measurement, where validity is determined by the VDAF itself. For
   example, the Prio3Sum variant of Prio3 ({{Section 7.4.2 of !VDAF}}) requires
   that the output shares sum up to an integer in a specific range, while the
   Prio3Histogram variant ({{Section 7.4.4 of !VDAF}}) proves that output shares
   sum up to a one-hot vector representing a contribution to a single bucket of
   the histogram.

In general, refinement and verification are not distinct computations, since for
some VDAFs, verification may only be achieved implicitly as a result of the
refinement process. We instead think of these as properties of the output shares
themselves: if preparation succeeds, then the resulting output shares are
guaranteed to combine into a valid, refined measurement.

VDAF preparation is mapped onto an aggregation job as illustrated in
{{agg-flow}}. The protocol is comprised of a sequence of HTTP requests from the
Leader to the Helper, the first of which includes the aggregation parameter, the
Helper's report share for each report in the job, and for each report the
initialization step for preparation. The Helper's response, along with each
subsequent request and response, carries the remaining messages exchanged during
preparation.

{: #agg-flow title="Overview of the DAP aggregation interaction."}

The number of steps, and the type of the responses, depends on the VDAF. The
message structures and processing rules are specified in the following
subsections.

In general, reports cannot be aggregated until the Collector specifies an
aggregation parameter. However, in some situations it is possible to begin
aggregation as soon as reports arrive. For example, Prio3 has just one valid
aggregation parameter (the empty string).

An aggregation job can be thought of as having three phases:

- Initialization: Begin the aggregation flow by disseminating report shares and
  initializing the VDAF prep state for each report.
- Continuation: Continue the aggregation flow by exchanging prep shares and
  messages until preparation completes or an error occurs.
- Completion: Finish the aggregate flow, yielding an output share corresponding
  to each report share in the aggregation job.

These phases are described in the following subsections.

### Aggregate Initialization {#agg-init}

The Leader begins an aggregation job by choosing a set of candidate reports that
pertain to the same DAP task and a job ID which MUST be unique within the scope
of the task. The job ID is a 16-byte value, structured as follows:

~~~
opaque AggregationJobID[16];
~~~

The Leader can run this process for many sets of candidate reports in parallel
as needed. After choosing a set of candidates, the Leader begins aggregation by
splitting each report into report shares, one for each Aggregator. The Leader
and Helper then run the aggregate initialization flow to accomplish two tasks:

1. Recover and determine which input report shares are valid.
1. For each valid report share, initialize the VDAF preparation process (see
   {{Section 5.2 of !VDAF}}).

The Leader and Helper initialization behavior is detailed below.

#### Leader Initialization {#leader-init}

The Leader begins the aggregate initialization phase with the set of candidate
reports as follows:

1. Generate a fresh AggregationJobID.
1. Decrypt the input share for each report share as described in
   {{input-share-decryption}}.
1. Check that the resulting input share is valid as described in
   {{input-share-validation}}.

If any step invalidates the report, the Leader rejects the report and removes
it from the set of candidate reports.

Next, for each report the Leader executes the following procedure:

~~~
(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init(
    vdaf_verify_key,
    agg_param,
    report_id,
    public_share,
    plaintext_input_share.payload)
~~~

where:

* `vdaf_verify_key` is the VDAF verification key for the task
* `agg_param` is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the Collector (see
  {{collect-flow}})
* `report_id` is the report ID, used as the nonce for VDAF sharding
* `public_share` is the report's public share
* `plaintext_input_share` is the Leader's `PlaintextInputShare`

The methods are defined in {{Section 5.8 of !VDAF}}. This process determines
the initial per-report `state`, as well as the initial `outbound` message to
send to the Helper. If `state` is of type `Rejected`, then the report is
rejected and removed from the set of candidate reports, and no message is sent
to the Helper.

If `state` is of type `Continued`, then the Leader constructs a `PrepareInit`
message structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  ReportMetadata report_metadata;
  opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
  HpkeCiphertext encrypted_input_share;
} ReportShare;

struct {
  ReportShare report_share;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} PrepareInit;
~~~

Each of these messages is constructed as follows:

  * `report_share.report_metadata` is the report's metadata.

  * `report_share.public_share` is the report's public share.

  * `report_share.encrypted_input_share` is the intended recipient's (i.e.
    Helper's) encrypted input share.

  * `payload` is set to the `outbound` message computed by the previous step.

It is not possible for `state` to be of type `Finished` during Leader
initialization.

Once all the report shares have been initialized, the Leader creates an
`AggregationJobInitReq` message structured as follows:

~~~
opaque BatchID[32];

struct {
  QueryType query_type;
  select (PartialBatchSelector.query_type) {
    case time_interval: Empty;
    case fixed_size: BatchID batch_id;
  };
} PartialBatchSelector;

struct {
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
  PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
  PrepareInit prepare_inits<1..2^32-1>;
} AggregationJobInitReq;
~~~

This message consists of:

* `agg_param`: The VDAF aggregation parameter.

* `part_batch_selector`: The "partial batch selector" used by the Aggregators to
  determine how to aggregate each report:

    * For `fixed_size` tasks, the Leader specifies a "batch ID" that determines
      the batch to which each report for this aggregation job belongs.

      [OPEN ISSUE: For fixed_size tasks, the Leader is in complete control over
      which batch a report is included in. For time_interval tasks, the Client
      has some control, since the timestamp determines which batch window it
      falls in. Is this desirable from a privacy perspective? If not, it might
      be simpler to drop the timestamp altogether and have the agg init request
      specify the batch window instead.]

  The indicated query type MUST match the task's query type. Otherwise, the
  Helper MUST abort with error `invalidMessage`.

  This field is called the "partial" batch selector because, depending on the
  query type, it may not determine a batch. In particular, if the query type is
  `time_interval`, the batch is not determined until the Collector's query is
  issued (see {{query}}).

* `prepare_inits`: the sequence of `PrepareInit` messages constructed in the
  previous step.

Finally, the Leader sends a request to
`PUT {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}`. The
payload is set to `AggregationJobInitReq` and the media type is set to
"application/dap-aggregation-job-init-req".

The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a scheme that
meets the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

After receiving HTTP status 201 Created, the Leader proceeds to poll the
aggregation job by sending requests to
`GET {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` until
receiving HTTP status 200 OK with a body containing an `AggregationJobResp`.
The response MAY include a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling
interval to the Leader.

The Helper's response will be an `AggregationJobResp` message (see
{{aggregation-helper-init}}. The response's `prepare_resps` must include exactly
the same report IDs in the same order as the Leader's `AggregationJobInitReq`.
Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort the aggregation job.

Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

1. If the inbound prep response has type "continue", then the Leader computes

   ~~~
   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(agg_param,
                                                       prev_state,
                                                       inbound)
   ~~~

   where:

   * `agg_param` is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the Collector (see
     {{collect-flow}})
   * `prev_state` is the state computed earlier by calling
     `Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init` or `Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued`
   * `inbound` is the message payload in the `PrepareResp`

   If `outbound != None`, then the Leader stores `state` and `outbound` and
   proceeds to {{aggregation-leader-continuation}}. If `outbound == None`, then
   the preparation process is complete: either `state == Rejected()`, in which
   case the Leader rejects the report and removes it from the candidate set; or
   `state == Finished(out_share)`, in which case preparation is complete and the
   Leader stores the output share for use in the collection interaction
   {{collect-flow}}.

1. Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report and removes
   it from the candidate set. The Leader MUST NOT include the report in a
   subsequent aggregation job, unless the error is `report_too_early`, in which
   case the Leader MAY include the report in a subsequent aggregation job.

1. Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

(Note: Since VDAF preparation completes in a constant number of rounds, it will
never be the case that some reports are completed and others are not.)

#### Helper Initialization {#aggregation-helper-init}

The Helper begins an aggregation job when it receives an `AggregationJobInitReq`
message from the Leader. For each `PrepareInit` conveyed by this message, the
Helper attempts to initialize VDAF preparation (see {{Section 5.1 of !VDAF}})
just as the Leader does. If successful, it includes the result in its response
that the Leader will use to continue preparing the report.

Upon receipt of an `AggregationJobInitReq`, the Helper checks if it recognizes
the task ID. If not, then it MUST abort with error `unrecognizedTask`.

Next, the Helper checks that the report IDs in
`AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits` are all distinct. If two preparation
initialization messages have the same report ID, then the Helper MUST abort with
error `invalidMessage`.

If the Helper finds the `AggregationJobInitReq` to be valid, it immediately
responds with HTTP status 201 Created. The Helper is now ready to process each
report share into an outbound prepare step, asynchronously from any further
requests from the leader.

The following structures are computed:

~~~
enum {
  continue(0),
  finished(1)
  reject(2),
  (255)
} PrepareRespState;

enum {
  batch_collected(0),
  report_replayed(1),
  report_dropped(2),
  hpke_unknown_config_id(3),
  hpke_decrypt_error(4),
  vdaf_prep_error(5),
  batch_saturated(6),
  task_expired(7),
  invalid_message(8),
  report_too_early(9),
  (255)
} PrepareError;

struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state;
  select (PrepareResp.prepare_resp_state) {
    case continue: opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
    case finished: Empty;
    case reject:   PrepareError prepare_error;
  };
} PrepareResp;
~~~

First the Helper preprocesses each report as follows:

1. Decrypt the input share for each report share as described in
   {{input-share-decryption}}.
1. Check that the resulting input share is valid as described in
   {{input-share-validation}}.

For any report that was rejected, the Helper sets the outbound preparation
response to

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  PrepareError prepare_error;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

where `report_id` is the report ID and `prepare_error` is the indicated error.
For all other reports it initializes the VDAF prep state as follows (let
`inbound` denote the payload of the prep step sent by the Leader):

~~~
(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_init(vdaf_verify_key,
                                               agg_param,
                                               report_id,
                                               public_share,
                                               plaintext_input_share.payload)
~~~

where:

* `vdaf_verify_key` is the VDAF verification key for the task
* `agg_param` is the VDAF aggregation parameter sent in the
  `AggregationJobInitReq`
* `report_id` is the report ID
* `public_share` is the report's public share
* `plaintext_input_share` is the Helper's `PlaintextInputShare`

This procedure determines the initial per-report `state`, as well as the
initial `outbound` message to send in response to the Leader. If `state` is of
type `Rejected`, then the Helper responds with

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  PrepareError prepare_error = vdaf_prep_error;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise the Helper responds with

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1> = outbound;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Finally, the Helper creates an `AggregationJobResp` to send to the Leader. This
message is structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  PrepareResp prepare_resps<1..2^32-1>;
} AggregationJobResp;
~~~

where `prepare_resps` are the outbound prep steps computed in the previous step.
The order MUST match `AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits`.

After receiving the response to its `AggregationJobInitReq`, the Leader makes
requests to
`GET {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` to check
on the status of the aggregation job. If the aggregation job is ready, the
Helper responds with HTTP status 200 OK and a body consisting of an
`AggregationJobResp`, with media type "application/dap-aggregation-job-resp".
If the aggregation job is not finished yet, the Helper responds with HTTP
status 202 Accepted. The response MAY include a Retry-After header field to
suggest a polling interval to the Leader.

Changing an aggregation job's parameters is illegal, so further requests to
`PUT /tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` for the same
`aggregation-job-id` but with a different `AggregationJobInitReq` in the body
MUST fail with an HTTP client error status code.

Additionally, it is not possible to rewind or reset the state of an aggregation
job. Once an aggregation job has been continued at least once (see
{{agg-continue-flow}}), further requests to initialize that aggregation job MUST
fail with an HTTP client error status code.

Finally, if `state == Continued(prep_state)`, then the Helper stores `state` to
prepare for the next continuation step ({{aggregation-helper-continuation}}).
Otherwise, if `state == Finished(out_share)`, then the Helper stores `out_share`
for use in the collection interaction ({{collect-flow}}).

#### Input Share Decryption {#input-share-decryption}

Each report share has a corresponding task ID, report metadata (report ID and,
timestamp), public share, and the Aggregator's encrypted input share. Let
`task_id`, `report_metadata`, `public_share`, and `encrypted_input_share`
denote these values, respectively. Given these values, an Aggregator decrypts
the input share as follows. First, it constructs an `InputShareAad` message
from `task_id`, `report_metadata`, and `public_share`. Let this be denoted by
`input_share_aad`. Then, the Aggregator looks up the HPKE config and
corresponding secret key indicated by `encrypted_input_share.config_id` and
attempts decryption of the payload with the following procedure:

~~~
plaintext_input_share = OpenBase(encrypted_input_share.enc, sk,
  "dap-11 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
  input_share_aad, encrypted_input_share.payload)
~~~

where `sk` is the HPKE secret key, `0x01` represents the Role of the sender
(always the Client), and `server_role` is the Role of the recipient Aggregator
(`0x02` for the Leader and `0x03` for the Helper). The `OpenBase()` function is
as specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE
configuration. If decryption fails, the Aggregator marks the report share as
invalid with the error `hpke_decrypt_error`. Otherwise, the Aggregator outputs
the resulting PlaintextInputShare `plaintext_input_share`.

#### Input Share Validation {#input-share-validation}

Validating an input share will either succeed or fail. In the case of failure,
the input share is marked as invalid with a corresponding PrepareError.

Before beginning the preparation step, Aggregators are required to perform the
following checks:

1. Check that the input share can be decoded as specified by the VDAF. If not,
   the input share MUST be marked as invalid with the error `invalid_message`.

1. Check if the report is too far into the future. Implementors can provide for
   some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock
   skew. If a report is rejected for this reason, the Aggregator SHOULD mark the
   input share as invalid with the error `report_too_early`.

1. Check if the report's timestamp has passed the task's `task_expiration` time.
   If so, the Aggregator MAY mark the input share as invalid with the error
   `task_expired`.

1. Check if the PlaintextInputShare contains unrecognized extensions. If so, the
   Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid with error `invalid_message`.

1. Check if the ExtensionType of any two extensions in PlaintextInputShare are
   the same. If so, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid with
   error `invalid_message`.

1. Check if the report has been previously aggregated. If so, the input share
   MUST be marked as invalid with the error `report_replayed`.

    * Implementation note: To detect replay attacks, each Aggregator is required
      to keep track of the set of reports it has processed for a given task.
      Because honest Clients choose the report ID at random, it is sufficient to
      store the set of IDs of processed reports. However, implementations may
      find it helpful to track additional information, like the timestamp, so
      that the storage used for anti-replay can be sharded efficiently.

1. If the report pertains to a batch that was previously collected, then the
   input share MUST be marked as invalid with error `batch_collected`.

    * Implementation note: The Leader considers a batch to be collected once it
      has completed a collection job for a CollectionReq message from the
      Collector; the Helper considers a batch to be collected once it has
      responded to an `AggregateShareReq` message from the Leader. A batch is
      determined by query ({{query}}) conveyed in these messages. Queries must
      satisfy the criteria covered in {{batch-validation}}. These criteria are
      meant to restrict queries in a way make it easy to determine wither a
      report pertains to a batch that was collected.

      [TODO: If a section to clarify report and batch states is added this can be
      removed. See Issue #384]

1. Depending on the query type for the task, additional checks may be
   applicable:

    * For `fixed_size` tasks, the Aggregators need to ensure that each batch is
      roughly the same size. If the number of reports aggregated for the current
      batch exceeds the maximum batch size (per the task configuration), the
      Aggregator MAY mark the input share as invalid with the error
      `batch_saturated`. Note that this behavior is not strictly enforced here
      but during the collect interaction. (See {{batch-validation}}.) If
      maximum batch size is not provided, then Aggregators only need to ensure
      the current batch exceeds the minimum batch size (per the task
      configuration). If both checks succeed, the input share is not marked as
      invalid.

1. Finally, if an Aggregator cannot determine if an input share is valid, it
   MUST mark the input share as invalid with error `report_dropped`. For
   example, if the Aggregator has evicted the state required to perform the
   check from long-term storage. (See {{reducing-storage-requirements}} for
   details.)

If all of the above checks succeed, the input share is not marked as invalid.

### Aggregate Continuation {#agg-continue-flow}

In the continuation phase, the Leader drives the VDAF preparation of each report
in the candidate report set until the underlying VDAF moves into a terminal
state, yielding an output share for both Aggregators or a rejection.

Whether this phase is reached depends on the VDAF: for 1-round VDAFs, like
Prio3, processing has already completed. Continuation is required for VDAFs
that require more than one round.

#### Leader Continuation {#aggregation-leader-continuation}

The Leader begins each step of aggregation continuation with a prep state object
`state` and an outbound message `outbound` for each report in the candidate set.

The Leader advances its aggregation job to the next step (step 1 if this is the
first continuation after initialization). Then it instructs the Helper to
advance the aggregation job to the step the Leader has just reached. For each
report the Leader constructs a preparation continuation message:

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} PrepareContinue;
~~~

where `report_id` is the report ID associated with `state` and `outbound`, and
`payload` is set to the `outbound` message.

Next, the Leader sends a request to
`POST {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` with
media type "application/dap-aggregation-job-continue-req" and body structured
as:

~~~
struct {
  uint16 step;
  PrepareContinue prepare_continues<1..2^32-1>;
} AggregationJobContinueReq;
~~~

The `step` field is the step of DAP aggregation that the Leader just reached and
wants the Helper to advance to. The `prepare_continues` field is the sequence of
preparation continuation messages constructed in the previous step. The
`PrepareContinue`s MUST be in the same order as the previous aggregate request.

The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a scheme that
meets the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

After receiving HTTP status 202 Accepted, the Leader proceeds to poll the
aggregation job by sending requests to
`GET {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` until
receiving HTTP status 200 OK with a body containing an `AggregationJobResp`.
The response MAY include a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling
interval to the Leader.

The response's `prepare_resps` must include exactly the same report IDs in the
same order as the Leader's `AggregationJobContinueReq`. Otherwise, the Leader
MUST abort the aggregation job.

[[OPEN ISSUE: consider relaxing this ordering constraint. See issue#217.]]

Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

1. If the inbound prep response type is "continue" and the state is
   `Continued(prep_state)`, then the Leader computes

   ~~~
   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(agg_param,
                                                       state,
                                                       inbound)
   ~~~

   where `inbound` is the message payload. If `outbound != None`, then the
   Leader stores `state` and `outbound` and proceeds to another continuation
   step. If `outbound == None`, then the preparation process is complete: either
   `state == Rejected()`, in which case the Leader rejects the report and
   removes it from the candidate set; or `state == Finished(out_share)`, in
   which case preparation is complete and the Leader stores the output share for
   use in the collection interaction {{collect-flow}}.

1. Else if the type is "finished" and `state == Finished(out_share)`, then
   preparation is complete and the Leader stores the output share for use in
   the collection flow ({{collect-flow}}).

1. Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report and removes
   it from the candidate set.

1. Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

#### Helper Continuation {#aggregation-helper-continuation}

The Helper begins each step of continuation with a sequence of `state` objects,
which will be `Continued(prep_state)`, one for each report in the candidate set.

The Helper awaits a request to
`POST {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` from the
Leader, the body of which is an `AggregationJobContinueReq` as specified in
{{aggregation-leader-continuation}}.

Next, it checks that it recognizes the task ID. If not, then it MUST abort with
error `unrecognizedTask`.

Next, it checks if it recognizes the indicated aggregation job ID. If not, it
MUST abort with error `unrecognizedAggregationJob`.

Next, the Helper checks that:

1. the report IDs are all distinct
1. each report ID corresponds to one of the `state` objects
1. `AggregationJobContinueReq.step` is not equal to `0`

If any of these checks fail, then the Helper MUST abort with error
`invalidMessage`. Additionally, if any prep step appears out of order relative
to the previous request, then the Helper MAY abort with error `invalidMessage`.
(Note that a report may be missing, in which case the Helper should assume the
Leader rejected it.)

Next, the Helper checks if the continuation step indicated by the request is
correct. (For the first `AggregationJobContinueReq` the value should be `1`;
for the second the value should be `2`; and so on.) If the Leader is one step
behind (e.g., the Leader has resent the previous HTTP request), then the Helper
MAY attempt to recover by sending HTTP 202 status Accepted. In this case it
SHOULD verify that the contents of the `AggregationJobContinueReq` are
identical to the previous message (see {{aggregation-step-skew-recovery}}).
Otherwise, if the step is incorrect, the Helper MUST abort with error
`stepMismatch`.

If the Helper finds the `AggregationJobContinueReq` to be valid, it immediately
responds with HTTP status 202 Accepted. The Helper is now ready to continue
preparation for each report, asynchronously from any further requests from the
Leader.

Let `inbound` denote the payload of the prep step. The Helper computes the
following:

~~~
(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_continued(agg_param,
                                                    state,
                                                    inbound)
~~~

If `state == Rejected()`, then the Helper's response is

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  PrepareError prepare_error = vdaf_prep_error;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise, if `outbound != None`, then the Helper's response is

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1> = outbound;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise, if `outbound == None`, then the Helper's response is

~~~
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = finished;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

After receiving the response to its `AggregationJobContinueReq`, the Leader
makes requests to
`GET {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` to check on
the status of the aggregation job. If the continuation is not finished yet,
the Helper responds with HTTP status 202 Accepted. The response MAY include a
Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the Leader.

If the aggregation job is ready, the Helper constructs an `AggregationJobResp`
message ({{aggregation-helper-init}}) with each prep step. The order of the
prep steps MUST match the Leader's `AggregationJobContinueReq`. It responds
to the Leader with HTTP status 200 OK, media type
`application/dap-aggregation-job-resp`, and a body consisting of the
`AggregationJobResp`.

Finally, if `state == Continued(prep_state)`, then the Helper stores `state` to
prepare for the next continuation step ({{aggregation-helper-continuation}}).
Otherwise, if `state == Finished(out_share)`, then the Helper stores `out_share`
for use in the collection interaction ({{collect-flow}}).

If for whatever reason the Leader must abandon the aggregation job, it SHOULD
send a request to
`DELETE {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` so that
the Helper knows it can clean up its state.

#### Recovering from Aggregation Step Skew {#aggregation-step-skew-recovery}

`AggregationJobContinueReq` messages contain a `step` field, allowing
Aggregators to ensure that their peer is on an expected step of the DAP
aggregation protocol. In particular, the intent is to allow recovery from a
scenario where the Helper successfully advances from step `n` to `n+1`, but its
`AggregationJobResp` response to the Leader gets dropped due to something like a
transient network failure. The Leader could then resend the request to have the
Helper advance to step `n+1` and the Helper should be able to retransmit the
`AggregationJobContinueReq` that was previously dropped. To make that kind of
recovery possible, Aggregator implementations SHOULD checkpoint the most recent
step's prep state and messages to durable storage such that the Leader can
re-construct continuation requests and the Helper can re-construct continuation
responses as needed.

When implementing an aggregation step skew recovery strategy, the Helper SHOULD
ensure that the Leader's `AggregationJobContinueReq` message did not change when
it was re-sent (i.e., the two messages must be identical). This prevents the
Leader from re-winding an aggregation job and re-running an aggregation step
with different parameters.

[[OPEN ISSUE: Allowing the Leader to "rewind" aggregation job state of the
Helper may allow an attack on privacy. For instance, if the VDAF verification
key changes, the prep shares in the Helper's response would change even if the
consistency check is made. Security analysis is required. See #401.]]

One way the Helper could address this would be to store a digest of the Leader's
request, indexed by aggregation job ID and step, and refuse to service a request
for a given aggregation step unless it matches the previously seen request (if
any).

## Collecting Results {#collect-flow}

In this phase, the Collector requests aggregate shares from each Aggregator and
then locally combines them to yield a single aggregate result. In particular,
the Collector issues a query to the Leader ({{query}}), which the Aggregators
use to select a batch of reports to aggregate. Each Aggregator emits an
aggregate share encrypted to the Collector so that it can decrypt and combine
them to yield the aggregate result. This entire process is composed of two
interactions:

1. Collect request and response between the Collector and Leader, specified in
   {{collect-init}}
1. Aggregate share request and response between the Leader and the Helper,
   specified in {{collect-aggregate}}

Once complete, the Collector computes the final aggregate result as specified in
{{collect-finalization}}.

This overall process is referred to as a "collection job".

### Collection Job Initialization {#collect-init}

First, the Collector chooses a collection job ID:

~~~
opaque CollectionJobID[16];
~~~

This ID value MUST be unique within the scope of the corresponding DAP task.

To initiate the collection job, the collector issues a PUT request to
`{leader}/tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}`. The body of the
request has media type "application/dap-collect-req", and it is structured as
follows:

~~~
struct {
  Query query;
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>; /* VDAF aggregation parameter */
} CollectionReq;
~~~

The named parameters are:

* `query`, the Collector's query. The indicated query type MUST match the task's
  query type. Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort with error "invalidMessage".
* `agg_param`, an aggregation parameter for the VDAF being executed. This is the
  same value as in `AggregationJobInitReq` (see {{leader-init}}).

Collectors MUST authenticate their requests to Leaders using a scheme that meets
the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

Depending on the VDAF scheme and how the Leader is configured, the Leader and
Helper may already have prepared a sufficient number of reports satisfying the
query and be ready to return the aggregate shares right away. However, this is
not always the case. In fact, for some VDAFs, it is not be possible to begin
running aggregation jobs ({{aggregate-flow}}) until the Collector initiates a
collection job. This is because, in general, the aggregation parameter is not
known until this point. In certain situations it is possible to predict the
aggregation parameter in advance. For example, for Prio3 the only valid
aggregation parameter is the empty string. For these reasons, the collection
job is handled asynchronously.

Upon receipt of a `CollectionReq`, the Leader begins by checking that it
recognizes the task ID in the request path. If not, it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`.

The Leader MAY further validate the request according to the requirements in
{{batch-validation}} and abort with the indicated error, though some conditions
such as the number of valid reports may not be verifiable while handling the
CollectionReq message, and the batch will have to be re-validated later on
regardless.

If the Leader finds the CollectionReq to be valid, it immediately responds with
HTTP status 201.

The Leader then begins working with the Helper to aggregate the reports
satisfying the query (or continues this process, depending on the VDAF) as
described in {{aggregate-flow}}.

Changing a collection job's parameters is illegal, so further requests to
`PUT /tasks/{tasks}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}` for the same
`collection-job-id` but with a different `CollectionReq` in the body MUST fail
with an HTTP client error status code.

After receiving the response to its `CollectionReq`, the Collector makes a
request `GET /tasks/{tasks}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}` to check on
the status of the collect job and eventually obtain the result. If the
collection job is not finished yet, the Leader responds with HTTP status 202
Accepted. The response MAY include a Retry-After header field to suggest a
polling interval to the Collector.

Asynchronously from any request from the Collector, the Leader attempts to run
the collection job. It first checks whether it can construct a batch for the
collection job by applying the requirements in {{batch-validation}}. If so, then
the Leader obtains the Helper's aggregate share following the aggregate-share
request flow described in {{collect-aggregate}}. If not, it either aborts the
collection job or tries again later, depending on which requirement in
{{batch-validation}} was not met. If the Leader has a pending aggregation job
that overlaps with the batch and aggregation parameter for the collection job,
the Leader MUST first complete the aggregation job before proceeding and
requesting an aggregate share from the Helper. This avoids a race condition
between aggregation and collection jobs that can yield trivial batch mismatch
errors.

Once both aggregate shares are successfully obtained, the Leader responds to
subsequent HTTP GET requests to the collection job with HTTP status code 200 OK
and a body consisting of a `Collection`:

~~~
struct {
  uint64 report_count;
  Interval interval;
  HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_agg_share;
  HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_agg_share;
} Collection;
~~~

The body's media type is "application/dap-collection". The `Collection`
structure includes the following:

* `report_count`: The number of reports included in the batch.

* `interval`: The smallest interval of time that contains the timestamps of all
  reports included in the batch, such that the interval's start and duration are
  both multiples of the task's `time_precision` parameter. Note that in the case
  of a `time_interval` type query (see {{query}}), this interval can be smaller
  than the one in the corresponding `CollectionReq.query`.

* `leader_encrypted_agg_share`: The Leader's aggregate share, encrypted to the
  Collector.

* `helper_encrypted_agg_share`: The Helper's aggregate share, encrypted to the
  Collector.

If obtaining aggregate shares fails, then the Leader responds to subsequent HTTP
GET requests to the collection job with an HTTP error status and a problem
document as described in {{errors}}.

The Leader MAY respond with HTTP status 204 No Content to requests to a
collection job if the results have been deleted.

The Collector can send an HTTP DELETE request to the collection job, which
indicates to the Leader that it can abandon the collection job and discard all
state related to it.

### Obtaining Aggregate Shares {#collect-aggregate}

The Leader must obtain the Helper's encrypted aggregate share before it can
complete a collection job. To do this, the Leader first computes a checksum
over the reports included in the batch. The checksum is computed by taking the
SHA256 {{!SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}} hash of each report ID from the
Client reports included in the aggregation, then combining the hash values with
a bitwise-XOR operation.

Then the Leader sends a POST request to
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregate_shares` with the following message:

~~~
struct {
  QueryType query_type;
  select (BatchSelector.query_type) {
    case time_interval: Interval batch_interval;
    case fixed_size: BatchID batch_id;
  };
} BatchSelector;

struct {
  BatchSelector batch_selector;
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
  uint64 report_count;
  opaque checksum[32];
} AggregateShareReq;
~~~

The media type of the request is "application/dap-aggregate-share-req". The
message contains the following parameters:

* `batch_selector`: The "batch selector", which encodes parameters used to
  determine the batch being aggregated. The value depends on the query type for
  the task:

    * For time_interval tasks, the request specifies the batch interval.

    * For fixed_size tasks, the request specifies the batch ID.

  The indicated query type MUST match the task's query type. Otherwise, the
  Helper MUST abort with "invalidMessage".

* `agg_param`: The opaque aggregation parameter for the VDAF being executed.
  This value MUST match the AggregationJobInitReq message for each aggregation
  job used to compute the aggregate shares (see {{leader-init}}) and the
  aggregation parameter indicated by the Collector in the CollectionReq message
  (see {{collect-init}}).

* `report_count`: The number number of reports included in the batch.

* `checksum`: The batch checksum.

Leaders MUST authenticate their requests to Helpers using a scheme that meets
the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

To handle the Leader's request, the Helper first ensures that it recognizes the
task ID in the request path. If not, it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`. The Helper then verifies that the request meets the
requirements for batch parameters following the procedure in
{{batch-validation}}.

Next, it computes a checksum based on the reports that satisfy the query, and
checks that the `report_count` and `checksum` included in the request match its
computed values. If not, then it MUST abort with an error of type
"batchMismatch".

Next, it computes the aggregate share `agg_share` corresponding to the set of
output shares, denoted `out_shares`, for the batch interval, as follows:

~~~
agg_share = Vdaf.aggregate(agg_param, out_shares)
~~~

Implementation note: For most VDAFs, it is possible to aggregate output shares
as they arrive rather than wait until the batch is collected. To do so however,
it is necessary to enforce the batch parameters as described in
{{batch-validation}} so that the Aggregator knows which aggregate share to
update.

The Helper then encrypts `agg_share` under the Collector's HPKE public key as
described in {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}, yielding `encrypted_agg_share`.
Encryption prevents the Leader from learning the actual result, as it only has
its own aggregate share and cannot compute the Helper's.

The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status code 200 OK and a body
consisting of an `AggregateShare`, with media type
"application/dap-aggregate-share":

~~~
struct {
  HpkeCiphertext encrypted_aggregate_share;
} AggregateShare;
~~~

`encrypted_aggregate_share.config_id` is set to the Collector's HPKE config ID.
`encrypted_aggregate_share.enc` is set to the encapsulated HPKE context `enc`
computed above and `encrypted_aggregate_share.ciphertext` is the ciphertext
`encrypted_agg_share` computed above.

The Helper's handling of this request MUST be idempotent. That is, if multiple
identical, valid `AggregateShareReq`s are received, they should all yield the
same response.

After receiving the Helper's response, the Leader uses the HpkeCiphertext to
finalize a collection job (see {{collect-finalization}}).

Once an AggregateShareReq has been issued for the batch determined by a given
query, it is an error for the Leader to issue any more aggregation jobs for
additional reports that satisfy the query. These reports will be rejected by the
Helper as described in {{input-share-validation}}.

Before completing the collection job, the Leader also computes its own aggregate
share `agg_share` by aggregating all of the prepared output shares that fall
within the batch interval. Finally, it encrypts its aggregate share under the
Collector's HPKE public key as described in {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}.

### Collection Job Finalization {#collect-finalization}

Once the Collector has received a collection job from the Leader, it can decrypt
the aggregate shares and produce an aggregate result. The Collector decrypts
each aggregate share as described in {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}. Once the
Collector successfully decrypts all aggregate shares, it unshards the aggregate
shares into an aggregate result using the VDAF's `unshard` algorithm. In
particular, let `leader_agg_share` denote the Leader's aggregate share,
`helper_agg_share` denote the Helper's aggregate share, let `report_count`
denote the report count sent by the Leader, and let `agg_param` be the opaque
aggregation parameter. The final aggregate result is computed as follows:

~~~
agg_result = Vdaf.unshard(agg_param,
                          [leader_agg_share, helper_agg_share],
                          report_count)
~~~

### Aggregate Share Encryption {#aggregate-share-encrypt}

Encrypting an aggregate share `agg_share` for a given `AggregateShareReq` is
done as follows:

~~~
enc, payload = SealBase(pk, "dap-11 aggregate share" || server_role || 0x00,
  agg_share_aad, agg_share)
~~~

where `pk` is the HPKE public key encoded by the Collector's HPKE key,
`server_role` is the Role of the encrypting server (`0x02` for the Leader and
`0x03` for a Helper), `0x00` represents the Role of the recipient (always the
Collector), and `agg_share_aad` is a value of type `AggregateShareAad`. The
`SealBase()` function is as specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the
ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

~~~
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
  BatchSelector batch_selector;
} AggregateShareAad;
~~~

* `task_id` is the ID of the task the aggregate share was computed in.
* `agg_param` is the aggregation parameter used to compute the aggregate share.
* `batch_selector` is the is the batch selector from the `AggregateShareReq`
  (for the Helper) or the batch selector computed from the Collector's query
  (for the Leader).

The Collector decrypts these aggregate shares using the opposite process.
Specifically, given an encrypted input share, denoted `enc_share`, for a given
batch selector, decryption works as follows:

~~~
agg_share = OpenBase(enc_share.enc, sk, "dap-11 aggregate share" ||
  server_role || 0x00, agg_share_aad, enc_share.payload)
~~~

where `sk` is the HPKE secret key, `server_role` is the Role of the server that
sent the aggregate share (`0x02` for the Leader and `0x03` for the Helper),
`0x00` represents the Role of the recipient (always the Collector), and
`agg_share_aad` is an `AggregateShareAad` message constructed from the task ID
and the aggregation parameter in the collect request, and a batch selector. The
value of the batch selector used in `agg_share_aad` is computed by the Collector
from its query and the response to its query as follows:

* For time_interval tasks, the batch selector is the batch interval specified in
  the query.

* For fixed_size tasks, the batch selector is the batch ID assigned sent in the
  response.

The `OpenBase()` function is as specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the
ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

### Batch Validation {#batch-validation}

Before a Leader runs a collection job or a Helper responds to an
AggregateShareReq, it must first check that the job or request does not violate
the parameters associated with the DAP task. It does so as described here. Where
we say that an Aggregator MUST abort with some error, then:

- Leaders should respond to subsequent HTTP GET requests to the collection job
  with the indicated error.
- Helpers should respond to the AggregateShareReq with the indicated error.

First the Aggregator checks that the batch respects any "boundaries" determined
by the query type. These are described in the subsections below. If the boundary
check fails, then the Aggregator MUST abort with an error of type
"batchInvalid".

Next, the Aggregator checks that batch contains a valid number of reports, as
determined by the query type. If the size check fails, then Helpers MUST abort
with an error of type "invalidBatchSize". Leaders SHOULD wait for more reports
to be validated and try the collection job again later.

Next, the Aggregator checks that the batch has not been queried with multiple
distinct aggregation parameters. If the batch has been queried with more than
one distinct aggregation parameter, the Aggregator MUST abort with error of type
"batchQueriedMultipleTimes".

Finally, the Aggregator checks that the batch does not contain a report that was
included in any previous batch. If this batch overlap check fails, then the
Aggregator MUST abort with error of type "batchOverlap". For time_interval
tasks, it is sufficient (but not necessary) to check that the batch interval
does not overlap with the batch interval of any previous query. If this batch
interval check fails, then the Aggregator MAY abort with error of type
"batchOverlap".

[[OPEN ISSUE: #195 tracks how we might relax this constraint to allow for more
collect query flexibility. As of now, this is quite rigid and doesn't give the
Collector much room for mistakes.]]

#### Time-interval Queries {#time-interval-batch-validation}

##### Boundary Check

The batch boundaries are determined by the `time_precision` field of the query
configuration. For the `batch_interval` included with the query, the Aggregator
checks that:

* `batch_interval.duration >= time_precision` (this field determines,
  effectively, the minimum batch duration)

* both `batch_interval.start` and `batch_interval.duration` are divisible by
  `time_precision`

These measures ensure that Aggregators can efficiently "pre-aggregate" output
shares recovered during the aggregation interaction.

##### Size Check

The query configuration specifies the minimum batch size, `min_batch_size`. The
Aggregator checks that `len(X) >= min_batch_size`, where `X` is the set of
reports successfully aggregated into the batch.

#### Fixed-size Queries {#fixed-size-batch-validation}

##### Boundary Check

For fixed_size tasks, the batch boundaries are defined by opaque batch IDs. Thus
the Aggregator needs to check that the query is associated with a known batch
ID; specifically, for an AggregateShareReq, the Helper checks that the batch ID
provided by the Leader corresponds to a batch ID used in a previous
`AggregationJobInitReq` for the task.

##### Size Check

The query configuration specifies the minimum batch size, `min_batch_size`, and
optionally the maximum batch size, `max_batch_size`. The Aggregator checks that
`len(X) >= min_batch_size`. And if `max_batch_size` is specified, also
`len(X) <= max_batch_size`, where `X` is the set of reports successfully
aggregated into the batch.

# Operational Considerations {#operational-capabilities}

The DAP protocol has inherent constraints derived from the tradeoff between
privacy guarantees and computational complexity. These tradeoffs influence how
applications may choose to utilize services implementing the specification.

## Protocol Participant Capabilities {#entity-capabilities}

The design in this document has different assumptions and requirements for
different protocol participants, including Clients, Aggregators, and Collectors.
This section describes these capabilities in more detail.

### Client Capabilities

Clients have limited capabilities and requirements. Their only inputs to the
protocol are (1) the parameters configured out of band and (2) a measurement.
Clients are not expected to store any state across any upload flows, nor are
they required to implement any sort of report upload retry mechanism. By design,
the protocol in this document is robust against individual Client upload
failures since the protocol output is an aggregate over all inputs.

### Aggregator Capabilities

Leaders and Helpers have different operational requirements. The design in this
document assumes an operationally competent Leader, i.e., one that has no
storage or computation limitations or constraints, but only a modestly
provisioned Helper, i.e., one that has computation, bandwidth, and storage
constraints. By design, Leaders must be at least as capable as Helpers, where
Helpers are generally required to:

- Support the aggregate interaction, which includes validating and aggregating
  reports; and
- Publish and manage an HPKE configuration that can be used for the upload
  protocol.

In addition, for each DAP task, the Helper is required to:

- Implement some form of batch-to-report index, as well as inter- and
  intra-batch replay mitigation storage, which includes some way of tracking
  batch report size. Some of this state may be used for replay attack
  mitigation. The replay mitigation strategy is described in
  {{input-share-validation}}.

Beyond the minimal capabilities required of Helpers, Leaders are generally
required to:

- Support the upload protocol and store reports; and
- Track batch report size during each collect flow and request encrypted output
  shares from Helpers.

In addition, for each DAP task, the Leader is required to:

- Implement and store state for the form of inter- and intra-batch replay
  mitigation in {{input-share-validation}}.

### Collector Capabilities

Collectors statefully interact with Aggregators to produce an aggregate output.
Their input to the protocol is the task parameters, configured out of band,
which include the corresponding batch window and size. For each collect
invocation, Collectors are required to keep state from the start of the protocol
to the end as needed to produce the final aggregate output.

Collectors must also maintain state for the lifetime of each task, which
includes key material associated with the HPKE key configuration.

## VDAFs and Compute Requirements

The choice of VDAF can impact the computation required for a DAP task. For
instance, the Prio3SumVec VDAF {{!VDAF}} requires each measurement to be vectors
of the same length, which all parties need to agree on prior to VDAF execution.
The computation required for such tasks increases linearly as a function of the
chosen length, as each vector element must be processed in turn.

Therefore, care must be taken that a DAP deployment can handle VDAF execution of
all possible VDAF configurations for any tasks which the deployment may be
configured for. Otherwise, an attacker may deny service by uploading many
expensive reports to a suitably-configured VDAF.

Applications which require computationally-expensive VDAFs can mitigate the
computation cost of aggregation in a few ways, such as producing aggregates over
a sample of the data or choosing a representation of the data permitting a
simpler aggregation scheme.

[[TODO: Discuss explicit key performance indicators, here or elsewhere.]]

## Aggregation Utility and Soft Batch Deadlines

A soft real-time system should produce a response within a deadline to be
useful. This constraint may be relevant when the value of an aggregate decreases
over time. A missed deadline can reduce an aggregate's utility but not
necessarily cause failure in the system.

An example of a soft real-time constraint is the expectation that input data can
be verified and aggregated in a period equal to data collection, given some
computational budget. Meeting these deadlines will require efficient
implementations of the input-validation protocol. Applications might batch
requests or utilize more efficient serialization to improve throughput.

Some applications may be constrained by the time that it takes to reach a
privacy threshold defined by a minimum number of reports. One possible solution
is to increase the reporting period so more samples can be collected, balanced
against the urgency of responding to a soft deadline.

## Protocol-specific Optimizations

Not all DAP tasks have the same operational requirements, so the protocol is
designed to allow implementations to reduce operational costs in certain cases.

### Reducing Storage Requirements

In general, the Aggregators are required to keep state for tasks and all valid
reports for as long as collection requests can be made for them. However, it is
not necessary to store the complete reports. Each Aggregator only needs to store
an aggregate share for each possible batch interval (for time-interval) or batch
ID (for fixed-size), along with a flag indicating whether the aggregate share
has been collected. This is due to the requirement that in the time-interval
case, the batch interval respect the boundaries defined by the DAP parameters;
and that in fixed-size case, a batch is determined entirely by a batch ID. (See
{{batch-validation}}.)

However, Aggregators are also required to implement several per-report checks
that require retaining a number of data artifacts. For example, to detect replay
attacks, it is necessary for each Aggregator to retain the set of report IDs of
reports that have been aggregated for the task so far. Depending on the task
lifetime and report upload rate, this can result in high storage costs. To
alleviate this burden, DAP allows Aggregators to drop this state as needed, so
long as reports are dropped properly as described in {{input-share-validation}}.
Aggregators SHOULD take steps to mitigate the risk of dropping reports (e.g., by
evicting the oldest data first).

Furthermore, the Aggregators must store data related to a task as long as the
current time has not passed this task's `task_expiration`. Aggregator MAY delete
the task and all data pertaining to this task after `task_expiration`.
Implementors SHOULD provide for some leeway so the Collector can collect the
batch after some delay.

# Compliance Requirements {#compliance}

In the absence of an application or deployment-specific profile specifying
otherwise, a compliant DAP application MUST implement the following HPKE cipher
suite:

- KEM: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (see {{!HPKE, Section 7.1}})
- KDF: HKDF-SHA256 (see {{!HPKE, Section 7.2}})
- AEAD: AES-128-GCM (see {{!HPKE, Section 7.3}})

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

DAP aims to achieve the privacy and robustness security goals defined in
{{Section 9 of !VDAF}}, even in the presence of an active attacker. It is
assumed that the attacker may control the network and have the ability to
control a subset of of Clients, one of the Aggregators, and the Collector for a
given task.

In the presence of this adversary, there are some threats DAP does not defend
against and which are considered outside of DAP's threat model. These are
enumerated below, along with potential mitigations.

Attacks on robustness:

1. Aggregators can defeat robustness by emitting incorrect aggregate shares, by
   omitting reports from the aggregation process, or by manipulating the VDAF
   preparation process for a single report. DAP follows VDAF in providing
   robustness only if both Aggregators honestly follow the protocol.
1. Clients may affect the quality of aggregate results by reporting false
   measurements. A VDAF can only verify that a submitted measurement is valid,
   not that it is true.
1. An attacker can impersonate multiple Clients, or a single malicious Client
   can upload an unexpectedly-large number of reports, in order to skew
   aggregate results or to reduce the number of measurements from honest Clients
   in a batch below the minimum batch size. See {{sybil}} for discussion and
   potential mitigations.

Attacks on privacy:

1. Clients can intentionally leak their own measurements and compromise their
   own privacy.
1. Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally, share
   unencrypted input shares in order to defeat the privacy of individual
   reports. DAP follows VDAF in providing privacy only if at least one
   Aggregator honestly follows the protocol.

Attacks on other properties of the system:

1. Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally, share
   unencrypted aggregate shares in order to reveal the aggregation result for a
   given batch.
1. Aggregators, or a passive network attacker between the Clients and the
   Leader, can examine metadata such as HTTP client IP in order to infer which
   Clients are submitting reports. Depending on the particulars of the
   deployment, this may be used to infer sensitive information about the Client.
   This can be mitigated for the Aggregator by deploying an anonymizing proxy
   (see {{anon-proxy}}), or in general by requiring Clients to submit reports at
   regular intervals independently of the measurement value such that the
   existence of a report does not imply the occurrence of a sensitive event.
1. Aggregators can deny service by refusing to respond to collection requests or
   aggregate share requests.
1. Some VDAFs could leak information to either Aggregator or the Collector
   beyond what the protocol intended to learn. It may be possible to mitigate
   such leakages using differential privacy ({{dp}}).

## Sybil Attacks {#sybil}

Several attacks on privacy or robustness involve malicious Clients uploading
reports that are valid under the chosen VDAF but incorrect.

For example, a DAP deployment might be measuring the heights of a human
population and configure a variant of Prio3 to prove that measurements are
values in the range of 80-250 cm. A malicious Client would not be able to claim
a height of 400 cm, but they could submit multiple bogus reports inside the
acceptable range, which would yield incorrect averages. More generally, DAP
deployments are susceptible to Sybil attacks {{Dou02}}, especially when carried
out by the Leader.

In this type of attack, the adversary adds to a batch a number of reports that
skew the aggregate result in its favor. For example, sending known measurements
to the Aggregators can allow a Collector to shrink the effective anonymity set
by subtracting the known measurements from the aggregate result. The result may
reveal additional information about the honest measurements, leading to a
privacy violation; or the result may have some property that is desirable to the
adversary ("stats poisoning").

Depending on the deployment and the specific threat being mitigated, there are
different ways to address Sybil attacks, such as:

1. Implementing Client authentication, as described in {{client-auth}}, likely
   paired with rate-limiting uploads from individual Clients.
1. Removing Client-specific metadata on individual reports, such as through the
   use of anonymizing proxies in the upload flow, as described in
   {{anon-proxy}}.
1. Differential privacy ({{dp}}) can help mitigate Sybil attacks to some extent.

## Client Authentication {#client-auth}

In settings where it is practical for each Client to have an identity
provisioned (e.g., a user logged into a backend service or a hardware device
programmed with an identity), Client authentication can help Aggregators (or an
authenticating proxy deployed between Clients and the Aggregators; see
{{anon-proxy}}) ensure that all reports come from authentic Clients. Note that
because the Helper never handles messages directly from the Clients, reports
would need to include an extension ({{upload-extensions}}) to convey
authentication information to the Helper. For example, a deployment might
include a Privacy Pass token ({{?I-D.draft-ietf-privacypass-architecture-16}})
in an extension to allow both Aggregators to independently verify the Client's
identity.

However, in some deployments, it will not be practical to require Clients to
authenticate, so Client authentication is not mandatory in DAP. For example, a
widely distributed application that does not require its users to log in to any
service has no obvious way to authenticate its report uploads.

## Anonymizing Proxies {#anon-proxy}

Client reports can contain auxiliary information such as source IP, HTTP user
agent, or Client authentication information (in deployments which use it, see
{{client-auth}}). This metadata can be used by Aggregators to identify
participating Clients or permit some attacks on robustness. This auxiliary
information can be removed by having Clients submit reports to an anonymizing
proxy server which would then use Oblivious HTTP {{!RFC9458}} to forward reports
to the DAP Leader. In this scenario, Client authentication would be performed by
the proxy rather than any of the participants in the DAP protocol.

## Differential Privacy {#dp}

DAP deployments can choose to ensure their aggregate results achieve
differential privacy ({{Vad16}}). A simple approach would require the
Aggregators to add two-sided noise (e.g. sampled from a two-sided geometric
distribution) to aggregate shares. Since each Aggregator is adding noise
independently, privacy can be guaranteed even if all but one of the Aggregators
is malicious. Differential privacy is a strong privacy definition, and protects
users in extreme circumstances: even if an adversary has prior knowledge of
every measurement in a batch except for one, that one measurement is still
formally protected.

## Task Parameters

Distribution of DAP task parameters is out of band from DAP itself and thus not
discussed in this document. This section examines the security tradeoffs
involved in the selection of the DAP task parameters. Generally, attacks
involving crafted DAP task parameters can be mitigated by having the Aggregators
refuse shared parameters that are trivially insecure (e.g., a minimum batch size
of 1 report).

### VDAF Verification Key Requirements {#verification-key}

Knowledge of the verification key would allow a Client to forge a report with
invalid values that will nevertheless pass verification. Therefore, the
verification key must be kept secret from Clients.

Furthermore, for a given report, it may be possible to craft a verification key
which leaks information about that report's measurement during VDAF preparation.
Therefore, the verification key for a task SHOULD be chosen before any reports
are generated. Moreover, it SHOULD be fixed for the lifetime of the task and not
be rotated. One way to ensure that the verification key is generated
independently from any given report is to derive the key based on the task ID
and some previously agreed upon secret (verify_key_seed) between Aggregators, as
follows:

~~~
verify_key = HKDF-Expand(
    HKDF-Extract(
        "verify_key",    # salt
        verify_key_seed, # IKM
    ),
    task_id,             # info
    VERIFY_KEY_SIZE,     # L
)
~~~

Here, VERIFY_KEY_SIZE is the length of the verification key, and HKDF-Extract
and HKDF-Expand are as defined in {{?RFC5869}}.

This requirement comes from current security analysis for existing VDAFs. In
particular, the security proofs for Prio3 require that the verification key is
chosen independently of the generated reports.

### Batch Parameters

An important parameter of a DAP deployment is the minimum batch size. If a batch
includes too few reports, then the aggregate result can reveal information about
individual measurements. Aggregators enforce the agreed-upon minimum batch size
during the collection protocol, but implementations SHOULD also opt out of
participating in a DAP task if the minimum batch size is too small. This
document does not specify how to choose an appropriate minimum batch size, but
an appropriate value may be determined from the differential privacy ({{dp}})
parameters in use, if any.

### Task Configuration Agreement and Consistency

In order to execute a DAP task, it is necessary for all parties to ensure they
agree on the configuration of the task. However, it is possible for a party to
participate in the execution of DAP without knowing all of the task's
parameters. For example, a Client can upload a report ({{upload-flow}}) without
knowing the minimum batch size that is enforced by the Aggregators during
collection ({{collect-flow}}).

Depending on the deployment model, agreement can require that task parameters
are visible to all parties such that each party can choose whether to
participate based on the value of any parameter. This includes the parameters
enumerated in {{task-configuration}} and any additional parameters implied by
upload extensions {{upload-extensions}} used by the task. Since meaningful
privacy requires that multiple Clients contribute to a task, they should also
share a consistent view of the task configuration.

## Infrastructure Diversity

DAP deployments should ensure that Aggregators do not have common dependencies
that would enable a single vendor to reassemble measurements. For example, if
all participating Aggregators stored unencrypted input shares on the same cloud
object storage service, then that cloud vendor would be able to reassemble all
the input shares and defeat privacy.
